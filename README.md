## Tasks

__Warning:__ Line already plans this. Please check and think what does that mean for us:

Looking into the BUSINESS CONNECT API

Line Criteria:  team strength, product/service idea, and overall service fit with LINE platform.

## Idea: Get Proposals (Eddee) or Send food?

**use case: Accept user order via Line's message**

> "i'm so hungry"

> "Want some food? yes/no"

> "yes"

> "what kind of food? (eg. pizza, burger, noodle)"

> "pizza"

> "[list of pizza menu] TLDR; (1,2,3,4...)"

> "2"

> "ok, please send your location"

> "..."

> [billing info] Confirm your order? (yes/no)"

> "yes"

> "Thanks, your pizza will be ready in 40min."

### Food delivery:
* Management of food delivery: Your order is on the way, we are outside,  
* Payment: how do you like to pay? (Linepay?)
* Sending pictures as categories and the user can navigate through. Creating his own shopping cart.


### How we get the location of the user?
1. Ask the user for Streetname/Postal Code
2. Send Link to our Server --> Our server gets via HTML5 his geolocation --> Send it via Line Chat back to us --> We can process it
3. Google Maps API?

### Wit.ai:
What Keywords we want to react to? (For Example: Burger, Italian, Name of Restaurants, Dinner, Happy Hours, Breakfast, Promotion, Recently visited, new, popular)

#### Keywords categories:
* Time,
* Kind of Food,
* Names (of restaurants)
* Recommendations and Reviews/Experiences

### Sticker:
If user send a sushi sticker --> We give him the next sushi location.
If user send hamburger --> We ask him for McDonalds or BurgerKing?
Every Restaurant has his own sticker set --> Each sticker has a seperate functionality
