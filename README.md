* Sending pictures as categories and the user can navigate through. Creating his own shopping cart.


### How we get the location of the user?
1. Ask the user for Streetname/Postal Code
2. Send Link to our Server --> Our server gets via HTML5 his geolocation --> Send it via Line Chat back to us --> We can process it
3. Google Maps API?

### Wit.ai:
What Keywords we want to react to? (For Example: Burger, Italian, Name of Restaurants, Dinner, Happy Hours, Breakfast, Promotion, Recently visited, new, popular)

#### Keywords categories:

* Kind of Food,
* Names (of restaurants)
