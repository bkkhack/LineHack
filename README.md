6. __Explain briefly why we should pick you__   
Despite a plethora of “efficient” web-based scheduling tools, it is estimated that corporate/enterprise professionals waste nearly 5 hours every week trying to schedule meetings. Amortized over 1 year, thats nearly 260 hours wasted per employee per year. Clearly there has to be a better way.
With over 580 Million global registered users, close to 220 Million active users and recent SME centric expansion such as LINE@, Terminus Bot seeks to seamlessly add a powerful new layer of convenience to the already ubiquitous social communications platform.
Team Terminus consists of a perfect blend of cutting edge technologists and business development minds to bring a unique concept to life.
Help us simplify scheduling events and meetings.

7. __What do you expect from joining LINE HACK?__
